# Today I Learned (TIL)

A project to make jornaling what I am learning easy and automatic and provides some insights into my learning and journaling habits. 

The basic behaviour of the project is that I get a text message every day asking what I learned. When I reply to the message my response is recorded.

There is an interface to review old entries and get insights on what I have been learning and how often I have been journling. 

## User Stories

1. As a lifelong learner, I want a daily prompt to jornal what I am learning, so that I am constantly reminded to keep learning.

2. As a lifelong learner, I want to be able to reply to the prompt with what I have learned, so that daily journaling is as easy as possible.

3. As a lifelong learner, I want to be able to live what I have been learning so that I can reflect on where I have came from.

### This is just a project for learning and practice.
